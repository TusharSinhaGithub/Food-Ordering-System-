        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>We are students of LNCT University, currently in our 4th semester. As part of our coursework, we have undertaken the task of creating an online food ordering system. This project aims to provide a convenient platform for users to browse through a variety of food options.</p>
        <p>Our team has put in considerable effort to design and develop this system, ensuring its functionality, usability, and reliability. From conceptualization to implementation, we have strived to incorporate the latest technologies and best practices in web development to deliver a seamless experience to our users.</p>
        <p>Through this project, we aim to not only fulfill the requirements of our academic curriculum but also contribute to the growing field of e-commerce and digital services. We believe that our online food ordering system will  benefit the university students and teachers.</p>
